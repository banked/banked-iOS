DEVELOPER PLATFORM AGREEMENT

These terms and conditions (the “Agreement”) constitute an agreement between Banked Ltd, company number 11047186, with its registered office at Ground Floor, Finchale House, Belmont Business Park, Durham, England, DH1 1TW (“Banked”, “we”, “our” or “us”) and you, the legal entity or sole proprietor identified in connection with your registration of a developer account, (“you”, “your” or “yours”) governing your access to and use of Banked’s software, software developer kits, libraries, application programming interfaces, documentation, sample code, templates and related materials made available to you by Banked (the “Developer Materials”). By accepting this Agreement or by accessing and using the Developer Materials you agree to be bound by this Agreement. You may not use the Developer Materials if you do not accept this Agreement. If you are using the Developer Materials on behalf of a legal entity, you warrant that you have authority to bind that legal entity to this Agreement, and by accepting this Agreement, you are doing so on behalf of that legal entity.

License, Access and Use. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Banked grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable right and license to use the Developer Materials to access, use and reproduce those Developer Materials solely for the purposes of developing, testing, and promoting your websites, applications and services (“Applications”) as contemplated by the documentation for the applicable Developer Materials. You may use Developer Materials only in connection with Banked’s products and services for which they are made available. If the Developer Materials include any libraries, sample code, or other materials we make available specifically for incorporation in your Applications (as indicated by the applicable documentation), you may incorporate those materials in your Applications and reproduce and distribute those Developer Materials as incorporated in your Applications. You may also modify any such sample code to the extent necessary to incorporate it in your Applications. We may modify or discontinue (including by ceasing our distribution of or support for) any or all of the Developer Materials at any time without notice and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your Applications function properly after any such modification or discontinuation. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your Applications when using the Developer Materials or your developer account. If Banked believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limitations, your ability to use the Developer Materials may be temporarily or permanently blocked. You will not use the Developer Materials to encourage or promote illegal activity. You agree that Banked may monitor your use of the Developer Materials to ensure quality, improve Banked’s products and services, and to verify your compliance with this Agreement. This monitoring may include Banked accessing and using your Applications to identify security issues that could affect Banked or its users. Banked may suspend access to the Developer Materials by you or your Applications without notice if Banked reasonably believes that you are in violation of this Agreement. The Developer Materials may include or be distributed with software or other materials that are provided under a separate license agreement (such as an open source license), and that separate license will govern the use of such software or other materials in the event of a conflict with this Agreement. Any such separate license agreement may be indicated in the license, notice, or readme files distributed with the applicable software or other materials or in related documentation.

Prohibitions and Limitations. You may use the Developer Materials only as expressly authorized under this Agreement only for the purpose of developing, testing, and promoting your Applications as permitted by section 1, and only through the interfaces and functionality we designate. You must comply with all instructions and requirements in any integration documents, guidelines or other documentation that we provide. Except as permitted under section 1, you will not: a) incorporate or compile any portion of the Developer Materials into your Applications or other digital or physical products, b) distribute, sub-license or otherwise provide any portion of the Developer Materials to any third party, c) modify or create derivative works of the Developer Materials, d) reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Developer Materials, e) create any Application that functions substantially in the same way as the Developer Materials and distribute, sub-license or otherwise provide it to any third party, f) perform any action with the intent of introducing to the Developer Materials or any of Banked’s products or services any viruses, worms, defects, trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature, g) remove, obscure, or alter any Banked terms of service or any links to or notices of such terms, or h) access the Developer Materials or any of Banked’s products or services for competitive purposes (including to connect to a competitive product or to create your own competitive product) or publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including uptime, response time and/or benchmarks) relating to the Developer Materials or any of Banked’s products or services. You may not use the Developer Materials with any software or other materials that are subject to licenses or restrictions (e.g., open source software licenses) that, when combined with the Developer Materials, would require us to disclose, license, distribute or otherwise make all or any part of such Developer Materials available to anyone. You may not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary or attribution notices on or in any Developer Materials. All licenses and rights granted to you in this Agreement are conditional on your continued compliance with this Agreement, and all such licenses and rights will immediately and automatically terminate if you do not comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.

Intellectual Property Rights. As between you and Banked, Banked owns all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Developer Materials, Banked’s Brand Features, Banked’s products and services, and all related technology, websites and content, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing (together, the “Banked Intellectual Property Rights”). Except for the limited rights expressly granted to you under this Agreement or any other agreement in force between Banked and you, Banked does not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to any Banked Intellectual Property Rights. If you provide Banked with any feedback concerning the Developer Materials or Banked’s products or services, you grant Banked a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, copy, modify, sublicense and otherwise exploit such feedback for any purpose, without any restriction or obligation to you based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.

Banked may be independently creating (or may receive from third parties) features, applications or other products or services that may be similar to or competitive with your Applications, and nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement in force between Banked and you will be construed as restricting or preventing Banked from doing so.

Branding and Publicity. This Agreement does not grant either party any right, title or interest in or to the other party’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features (“Brand Features”). You may not use Banked’s Brand Features without Banked’s prior written consent. Any permitted use by you of Banked’s Brand Features will at all times comply with Banked brand guidelines, and any other instructions given by Banked from time to time.

You must conduct all such activities truthfully and without implying that your Application is created, sponsored, or endorsed by Banked and you may not make any representations, guarantees or warranties on behalf of Banked or with respect to the Developer Materials or Banked’s products or services.

Amendments and Modifications. Banked may amend this Agreement or any part thereof from time to time to, for example, reflect changes in applicable law or modifications to the Developer Materials. Changes will become effective thirty (30) days after they are notified to you, provided however, that changes addressing modifications to the Developer Materials or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. You acknowledge and agree that such changes may adversely affect how your Application accesses or communicates with the Developer Materials. If any change is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate this Agreement by ceasing all use of the Developer Materials. Your continued use of the Developer Materials will constitute binding acceptance of any change. While Banked may provide you with support or modifications to the Developer Materials, Banked is under no obligation to do so and have no obligation to fix or respond to errors you may encounter. Without any liability to you, Banked may in its discretion add, remove or modify any features of the Developer Materials, impose additional eligibility requirements or restrictions for access to the Developer Materials or discontinue providing the Developer Materials. If Banked modifies the Developer Materials, Banked may require you to use the modified version in order to continue using the Developer Materials.
